a. To design a data ingestion pipeline that collects and stores data from various sources, you can follow these steps:\par
Identify the data sources: Determine the different types of sources you want to collect data from, such as databases, APIs, streaming platforms, or file systems.\par
Define data extraction methods: Determine the appropriate methods to extract data from each source. For databases, you can use SQL queries or database connectors. For APIs, you can use RESTful API calls or SDKs. For streaming platforms, you can utilize streaming frameworks like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink. For file systems, you can use file parsers or libraries specific to the file format.\par

Model training: Train the modified model using a labeled dataset for image classification. Adjust the weights of the new layers to optimize the model's performance.\par
Fine-tuning: Gradually unfreeze some of the frozen layers in the pretrained model and continue training with a smaller learning rate. Fine-tune the weights of these layers to adapt them to the specific classification task.\par
Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained deep learning model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Test the model on a separate validation or test dataset.\par
